/* Heading and info:
	Rus Hoffman
	
	In this program you will modify the code you created for program 1 - Tic Tac Toe
	Playing one game of Tic-Tac-Toe is nice, but we usually want to play several games to account for mistakes, errors, or simply bad play
	For this reason, you will enclose your existing code in a user-controlled loop that will continue to play the game until the user decides to terminate the loop
	While the game is running, you will keep track of :
		Number of individual games won
		Number of games won by X
		Number of games won by O
	In addition, if the user makes an invalid menu selection or chooses to play a 1 player game you should present them with an appropriate message and return them to the menu rather than exiting the program.
	After the user terminates the game, the program should return to the menu
	If the user decides to end the game, you are required to report :
		The total number of games played during this "session"
		The total number of games won by X this "session"
		The total number of games won by O this "session"
		The total number of games resulting in a tie this "session"
	In addition, you will report the same information with a "historical" context by reading the statistics from a file you will create called "TTTStats.txt"
	The file will be read in, used and then you will update the values stored in the file when the user exits the program
